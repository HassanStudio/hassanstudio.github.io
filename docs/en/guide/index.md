# About <!--@include: @/.vitepress/snippets/app-name.md-->

Welcome to <!--@include: @/.vitepress/snippets/app-name.md-->!

## What is <!--@include: @/.vitepress/snippets/app-name.md-->

<!--@include: @/.vitepress/snippets/app-name.md--> is a script executor crafted specifically for Xcode, inspired by Hassan-i-Sabbah, the legendary "Old Man of the Mountain" from Fate. Like a stealthy assassin moving through shadows, it works invisibly yet swiftly to solve pain points in your development workflow.

## Why We Built <!--@include: @/.vitepress/snippets/app-name.md-->

The original motivation came from Xcode's lack of a "Copy Relative Path" feature, which I frequently needed when working with various CLI AI tools—a feature readily available in VS Code and Cursor.

By chance, I discovered an unassuming feature in Xcode called "Open with External Editor." This became the breakthrough that led to developing <!--@include: @/.vitepress/snippets/app-name.md-->, a more versatile script executor.
